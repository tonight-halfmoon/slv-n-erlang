%% Why programming with sockets fun? Because it allows applications to interact with other machines on the Internet, which has far more potential than just performing local operations.

%% In this chapter, we'll see how to program client and servers using TCP and UDP sockets.
%% We'll go through the different forms of servers that are possible (parallel, sequential, blocking, and nonblocking) and see how to program traggic-shaping applications that can control the flow of data to the application.

    %% Open a TCP socket to port 80 of host by calling gen_tcp:connect

    %% {packet,0} means the TCP data is delivered directly to the applicaion in an unmodified form.
    {ok, Socket} = gen_tcp:connect(Host, 80, [binary, {packet, 0}]),
